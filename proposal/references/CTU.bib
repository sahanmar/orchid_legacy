  abstract  = {While a visual unconstrained tree structure planar layout design is easy to implement, a visualization of a tree with constraints on node ranks and their ordering within ranks leads to a difficult combinatorial problem. A genealogical graph, such as family tree, can be taken as an example of such a case. Classical ancestor trees, descendant trees, Hourglass charts, and their visual variants such as node-link diagrams or fan charts are suitable for assessment of peoples relationships when one is focused on a particular person and his/her direct ancestors and descendants. Such tree-based representations miss a broader context of relationships and do not allow the quick assessment of several interlinked families together. We propose a new undirected tree-driven layout technique for layered multitree graph visualizations producing constraints on node layers and ordering of groups of nodes within layers. The computed constraints can be mapped, at least partially, into the DOT language property directives used by the Graphviz toolbox. We demonstrate achievements on several datasets containing up to 39000 people.},

  abstract  = {A large number dimensions may cause a variety of problems in real-world applications: some dimensions might be redundant and can worsen the quality of the workflow output, and, in the vast majority of exercises with datasets, data are distributed along a highly nonlinear manifold whose structure is unknown.
This paper focuses on analyzing the outputs of nonlinear dimensionality reduction, or Manifold Learning, techniques.
We introduce three meaningful measures that are capable of providing context behind projections onto lower-dimensional spaces.
The measures will enable us to compare techniques with each other and assist in choosing suitable hyperparameters.
Moreover, we propose to view projections from the standpoint of simplicial complex distortion.
In connection to that, we establish the process of a dimension-agnostic graph-based data tessellation technique that builds a simplicial skeleton of high-dimensional data.
Alongside our new tessellation technique, we evaluate the proposed quality measures on the Delaunay-tessellation-based simplicial approximations of manifolds.},

In this paper, we introduce an approach to the task that converts the problem of bandwidth evaluation in the Parzen-window-like framework into the non-parametric evaluation of a fine-grained density estimate which can then be scaled by means of the Scale-Space theory to achieve the desired level of smoothness. The detailed estimate is realized through the Delaunay space tessellation method and properties of its output simplices. Additionally, in the experimental part of the paper, we showcase the new method and demonstrate its outputs at various scales, reaching results that perceivably outperform its counterparts.},
